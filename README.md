## Overview
One of my absolute favorite articles about Haskell and the technical interview more generally is Typing the Technical Interview by Kyle Kingsbury "Aphyr" [Link](https://aphyr.com/posts/342-typing-the-technical-interview). The setting is a technical coding interview, the problem given is N-Queens (Given an NxN chessboard arrange N queens on the board safely). Maybe out of spite or maybe just for fun Aphyr solves using Haskell in a most abstract way. The post inspired me to learn Haskell and I have recreated his program here.
